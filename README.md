# Minccino
An All-Purpose Discord Bot. 

The bot is based off of [Red bot](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot). HUGE Thanks to [sagwayaya](https://twitter.com/sagwayaya) for help on graphics!

Minccino asks for permission to manage messages because it needs the ability to delete your reaction when using the -osutop command. 

If you find any bugs and/or have suggestions for extra features, please let me know in the issues section of this page!  

FAQ:  
Q: Will you add tracking?  
A: No.  
Q: Why not?  
A. There are already plenty of Discord bots that spam the osu! API over and over to track a couple plays--I don't want to spam it any more than needed. If you need tracking you can simply just use BoatBot or owo bot(ily Stevy).  
Q: But-  
A: Bro no means no what the fuck
