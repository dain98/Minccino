![Minccino - A Multi-Purpose Discord Bot](http://zenith.blue/i/49ipw.png)


The bot is based off of [Red bot](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot). The -osutop and -compare commands are **heavily** inspired by [owo bot](https://github.com/AznStevy/owo).

Minccino asks for permission to manage messages because it needs the ability to delete your reaction when using the -osutop command.

## FAQ:  
Q: Will you add tracking?  
`A: No. There are already plenty of Discord bots that spam the osu! API over and over to track a couple plays--I don't want to spam it any more than needed. If you need tracking you can simply just use BoatBot or owo bot(ily Stevy).`  
Q: The pp value isn't exactly the same/the same as pp if FC! Why does this happen?  
`A: When sliderends are dropped during a play, it makes exact pp calculations impossible(for now) because it can't tell if it was an FC with dropped sliderends or a sliderbreak at the end. I apologize for this :(`  
Q: Is this the final version of the bot?  
`A: If anything, it's the very first version! I have so much more that I want to do with this bot, possibly with games that are not osu!. I'll keep people updated through this site, and if people want it badly enough I'll make a Discord server dedicated to the bot, where I post new updates/changes the moment they're made.`
